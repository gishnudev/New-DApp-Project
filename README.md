# Decentralized Supply Chain Management
## Abstract:
### This project presents a decentralized supply chain management system using Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS to enhance transparency, authenticity, and security in product tracking. Each product is represented as an ERC-721 NFT, ensuring uniqueness and preventing counterfeiting. Metadata, including product details and shipment history, is stored securely on IPFS. Smart contracts handle ownership transfers and emit events at key stages, such as product creation, transfer, and delivery. Users, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers, interact with the system through a React-based frontend with MetaMask integration. Transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring a tamper-proof audit trail. The system eliminates fraud, middlemen manipulation, and inefficiencies in traditional supply chains. Deployment and interaction occur on an Ethereum test network for demonstration. Future enhancements include IoT integration for real-time tracking and AI-driven analytics. This solution ensures trust, security, and efficiency in modern supply chains.
